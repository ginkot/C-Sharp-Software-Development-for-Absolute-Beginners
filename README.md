[About]

C# Software Development for Absolute Beginners includes 12+ hours of C# learning. Not previous experience or knowledge is necessary! It is designed to be both: educational and fun. We keep the course engaging by using trending and entertaining examples.

You will learn the same (and more) C# programming knowledge than a typical university graduate student. I know this because I went to university myself! I have been teaching software development since 2003, so just over 20 years now!

Want to develop video games in Unity? Did you know that Unity uses C# behind the scenes? This course will give you a strong C# foundation for game development in Unity.

You will begin by learning the core features of programming: variables, methods, loops, conditions and data types. You will then move on to learn about Object Orientated Programming (O-O): Classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation etc, and then onto more advanced features of C# and the .NET framework, such as: file-handling, recursion, dealing with exceptions (errors), method overloading, debugging and lots lots more!!

By the end of this course you will have built a really solid foundation of, not only C#, but programming concepts, programming knowledge and typical industry programming practices.

All of the source code for the sample projects are included and ready for you to download.

This course is designed to keep you engaged throughout. It includes many coding examples and exercises so that you can test your knowledge of everything you have learned.

There is a final project at the end of this course. This final project is an optional challenge should you wish to undertake it!
